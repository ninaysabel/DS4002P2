### 1) Software and Platform 
Our project was conducted using both Mac and Windows platforms. For our analysis we used Python, and its subsequent pandas and matplotlib libraries.

### 2) Documentation 
- Data Folder: this folder contains our combined, merged data in a singular csv, titled "GSSdata.csv," as well as the several individual csv files we used prior to merging the data into one csv.
- Scripts Folder: this folder contains all .py files needed to reproduce our project results.
- Output Folder: this folder contains all of the output generated by this project.

### 3) Result Replication 
1. Download fixed"".csv files from the DATA folder
2. Go to the SCRIPTS file and download or copy the contents of the "Project2M1.ipynb"
3. Open VS Code and open the file you downloaded or create a new file and paste the contents
4. Run the file from beginning to end!
