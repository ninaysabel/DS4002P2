### 1) Software and Platform 
Our project was conducted using both Mac and Windows platforms. For our analysis we used Python, and its subsequent pandas and matplotlib libraries.

### 2) Documentation 
- Data Folder: this folder contains our combined, merged data in a singular csv, titled "GSSdata.csv," as well as the several individual csv files we used prior to merging the data into one csv.
- Scripts Folder: this folder contains all .py files needed to reproduce our project results.
- Output Folder: this folder contains all of the output generated by this project.

### 3) Result Replication 
1. Git Clone the Repo
2. Open VS Code and open the Repo
3. Go to the SCRIPTS file and open "Project2M1.ipynb"
4. Change this line "data_path = "/Users/addisonlowman/DS4002P2/DATA/" - to your complete path to the DATA folder in the repo
5. Run the contents in order and you will get the same results!
