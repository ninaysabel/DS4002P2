### 1) Software and Platform 
Our project was conducted using both Mac and Windows platforms. For our analysis we used Python, and its subsequent pandas and matplotlib libraries.

### 2) Documentation 
- Data Folder: this folder contains our combined, merged data in a singular csv, titled "GSSdata.csv," as well as the several individual csv files we used prior to merging the data into one csv.
- Scripts Folder: this folder contains all .py files needed to reproduce our project results.
- Output Folder: this folder contains all of the output generated by this project.

### 3) Result Replication 
1. Download the various CSV files from the data folder
2. Run through the data prepping that is located in the Project2M1.ipynb file. This will merge the datasets all into 1, as well as, drop uneeded columns and filter out bad results. 
3. Run the analysis code located at the bottom of the same file.
